Vanilla Minecraft experience with improvements like:

Compatible with the [MultiMC Launcher](https://multimc.org/).

A beta for Minecraft 1.17.1 is available. Changelog is available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/hexandcubes-client-tweaks/files/3429527).
The beta version uses an experimental version of forge, and will not work with the MultiMC Launcher.
